# ball_-chaser_Udacity
The second project on Udacity's robotics nano-degree involved uploading the first project's Gazebo space. To this was added a modelled robot. The robot was then programmed to recognise white pixels in odometry passed to it, and to turn toward this colour- once recognised.

Whilst requiring cpp files that would retrieve three-dimensional pixel data from the robot's camera (and respond appropriately to it), this project focued on the interactions of several systems: the camera and the lazer-view in Rviz, Cmake files, Gazebo, and writing Cpp files as plugins into XML files. These were all controlled via the Linux command line, often using BASH.

The above is the orthogonal Gazebo view, with placed robot and ball.

Here, lazer visualisation and the camera are visible in the Rviz system.

Finally, the robot in action, running to the ball-chaser source code.
